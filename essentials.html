							<h2>Multibit screwdriver</h2>
							<p class="step-text">
								Ah what a beauty. The multibit screwdriver is one of the most
								useful and cost effective tools you can get yourself. You can
								get so much done with just that. Everything from laptops, phones
								and basically most of the things you need to get into can be
								conquered with that incredible tool. It is also modular which
								can be incredibly cost saving if you always forget your tools
								like I do, because when you forget a bit you can just buy a new
								one cheap.
							</p>
							<p class="step-text">
								That doesn’t mean it’s all good though. Firstly, it’s expensive
								at first. Usually much more than a regular screwdriver. Also
								even though as we mentioned above bits are cheap, they are SO
								EASY TO LOSE. You can’t get away without losing one if you are
								regularly using it. It’s just a part of the experience :|.
								Although we have a <a href="#third-step">tip</a> for minimizing
								that too ;).

							<h2>Adjustable wrench</h2>
							<p class="step-text">
								The wrench basically does the things that the screwdriver does
								not. It’s the second most common tool you will need for your
								home fixes. Everything more sturdy usually requires some size of
								a wrench. And with an adjustable wrench you can have a big
								variety of wrench sizes in one which is way cheaper than buying
								them all.
							</p>
							<p class="step-text">
								However it really isn’t good if you are using it regularly. It
								gets off the nuts, rounds them off so often and you can really
								go crazy if you are using it for
								<a href=""><i>big torque*</i></a> nuts. So if you are a
								passionate mechanic I recommend getting a proper set of
								wrenches.

							<h2>Toolbox/Organizer</h2>
							<p class="step-text">
								Basically if you don’t want to lose everything you bought you
								will need a box. Keeping your collection of drivers, screws, and
								bolts in an easy-to-haul toolbox keeps things organized and
								handy. Also a separated tray for keeping your screws organized,
								because not being able to put the thing you fixed together is
								kind of a problem.
